                <h2>History of Steganography</h2>
                <p>Herodotus' Histories contains the first known textual example
                    of steganography. He claims that it occurred during the Ionian
                    Revolt, a rebellion of certain Greek cities against Persian
                    control in roughly 500 BC. Histiaeus, the ruler of Miletus, was
                    away from his city serving as an adviser to the Persian
                    monarch. He intended to return to Miletus, which was
                    controlled by his son-in-law, Aristagoras, so he plotted an
                    uprising in Ionia as a pretext for his homecoming. This is
                    where steganography comes in. He shaved a slave's head
                    and tattooed a statement on his scalp. [1]
                </p>

                <p>Histiaeus then waited for the slave's hair to grow back, hiding
                    the message, before sending him to Aristagoras with
                    instructions to shave the slave's head again and read the
                    letter. The hidden writing instructed him to rise up against
                    Persian rule, igniting the revolt against their invaders.
                    Herodotus recounts another incident with steganography that
                    occurred several years later, when Spartan king Demaratus
                    returned a supposedly blank wax tablet to Sparta. A message
                    was hidden inside the wax, warning the Spartans about
                    Xerxes' impending assault. Herodotus is infamous for his wild
                    tales, so we can't be certain how true these stories are, but
                    they are the oldest recordings of steganography we have.

                <p>It wasn't long before more advanced types of steganography
                    were discovered. In the fourth century BC, Aeneas Tacticus
                    mentioned a hole punching technique. Philo of Byzantium was
                    the first to write about invisible inks, in the third century BC.
                    His recipe involved writing text with gall nuts and revealing it
                    with a copper sulfate solution. Johannes Trithemius coined the
                    term "steganography" in his book Steganographia. The name
                    is a combination of the Greek words steganos (concealed)
                    and graphein (writing). Steganographia was a brilliant book
                    that claimed to be about magic and the occult but concealed
                    its true subject matter, which was concentrated on
                    cryptography and steganography.[1]                                      
                </p>

                <p>Steganographia was followed by Polygraphia, which appeared
                    after Trithemius' death in 1518. This was a more
                    straightforward book on steganography and its use. Another
                    significant advancement in steganography occurred in 1605,
                    when Francis Bacon created Bacon's cipher. This method
                    employed two distinct typefaces to encode a secret message
                    into seemingly benign text. Microdots were first invented in the
                    second half of the nineteenth century, although they were not
                    widely utilized for steganography until World War I. They
                    include reducing a message or image to the size of a dot,
                    allowing people to communicate and share information without
                    their adversaries knowing.

                <p>There have been numerous other steganographic
                    developments and approaches over the years. Steganography
                    is still practiced today, with low-tech variants commonly
                    utilized by prison gangs and digital methods used to hide data
                    in images, sound files, and other media.
                </p>



                <h2>History of related work</h2>
                <p>Dey et al. [3] suggested an image steganographic approach
                    using the sudoku puzzle. The suggested approach uses an
                    8x8 sudoku matrix as a key to encrypt and decrypt the secret
                    message. The proposed approach converts the secret
                    message's ASCII value to base-8 numbers, which are then
                    saved in an array. Each sudoku cell's value is translated to
                    binary and represented by the least significant bit of the blue
                    component of each set of 9 pixels in the cover image.
                </p>
                <p>In 2021, Bansal et al. [2] proposed a steganographic
                    technique inspired by the rook chess piece. The process
                    divides the cover image into n√ó1 pixel blocks, which are
                    equivalent to 64 bits, similar to chessboard squares. Each
                    block represents black and white rook pieces, with bit values
                    of 0 and 1, respectively. The hidden message is incorporated
                    in the cover image depending on the functional output of each
                    block, which is computed by taking into account the number of
                    rook positions under attack from opponents.
                </p>
                <p>Hussien et al. [2] suggested a coverless picture
                    steganography method using jigsaw puzzle image generating.
                    The proposed method breaks an image into blocks and
                    produces a jigsaw puzzle stego-picture using secret message
                    bits and a mapping function. To extract the payload,
                    reassemble the puzzle. Our suggested method outperforms
                    existing coverless image steganography algorithms in terms of
                    hiding capacity, security, and resilience.
                </p>
                <p>However, none of the three chess-steganography approaches
                    stated use an image of a chessboard to conceal a hidden
                    message.
