# Data Hiding Using Chess - Research Website  

This website presents a research project on steganography and encryption using chess as a cover medium. The project explores how chess games can be used to securely encode and transmit information through legal game moves and board positions.  

## Features  
- **Introduction to Steganography:** Overview of data hiding techniques and their applications.  
- **Historical Context:** Discussion on early examples of steganography and related work in game-based data hiding.  
- **Chess-Based Encoding & Steganography:** Explanation of methods to embed data in chess games.  
- **Applications & Limitations:** Use cases and potential drawbacks of chess-based steganography.  
- **Future Work & Enhancements:** Optimizing security, efficiency, and potential real-world applications.  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML** – For structuring the content.  
- **CSS** – For styling and layout.  
- **JavaScript** – For interactivity and dynamic elements.  

## How to Use  
1. Clone or download the repository.  
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.  
3. Navigate through the different sections to explore the research.  

## Future Enhancements  
- Implement interactive chessboard visuals.  
- Add an encryption demo using chess-based steganography.  
- Improve responsiveness and accessibility.
